For the purpose of testing, you can decide to run an mcp endpoint alone

It will create an endpoint that will launch an mcp_agent, that will connect to mcp_middleware


Launch MCP Server (https://github.com/fcn06/mcp_server)
```bash
./target/release/main-server
```
Launch mcp_endpoint ( as per configuration, this uses groq and qwen3 , but it can also run on gemini )
```bash
LLM_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>  ./target/release/mcp_agent_endpoint
```
Then you can test with the following curl request
```bash
curl -d '{"role":"user", "content":"What is the address of customer 1234 ?"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/msg
```
