List of commands to be executed for a full distributed skillset testing
We will launch three agents , each connected to a specific set of tools
And an orchestrator connected to three previously defined agents
Then we will ask specific questions targetting one set of tools at a time to all four agents
A script will come later to automate execution.

**************************************************************************
THESE COMMANDS HAVE TO BE SENT FROM THE ROOT OF THE REPOSITORY
**************************************************************************

A) Compile the project

cargo build --release 


B) Compile the mcp server example

cargo build --release --example main-server


C) Launch three MCP server, each with individual tool on three different ports

./target/release/examples/main-server --port 8001 weather &
./target/release/examples/main-server --port 8002 customer &
./target/release/examples/main-server --port 8003 scrape &


D) Launch three agents listening on three different ports (8081,8083,8085), each using mcp config
Export LLM_A2A_API_KEY and LLM_MCP_API_KEY beforehand


./target/release/simple_agent_server  --config-file "documentation/use_case_combined_agents/weather_a2a_agent_config.toml" &
./target/release/simple_agent_server  --config-file "documentation/use_case_combined_agents/customer_domain_a2a_agent_config.toml" &
./target/release/simple_agent_server  --config-file "documentation/use_case_combined_agents/web_scraper_a2a_agent.toml" &


E) Launch full agent listening on port 9080, connected to three individual agents
Export  LLM-FULL-API-KEY beforehand

./target/release/full_agent_server --config-file "documentation/use_case_combined_agents/agent_full_config.toml" &


F) Launch the a2a_client with 4 requests, three of them are targetting a specific tool, and the fourth a general knowledge question

Ask the questions to first agent . He should answer to the scraping question
./target/release/simple_a2a_client --port 8081
Ask the questions to second agent. He should answer to the weather question
./target/release/simple_a2a_client --port 8083
Ask the questions to third agent. He should answer to the customer question
./target/release/simple_a2a_client --port 8085

Ask the questions to full agent, the orchestrator one : He should answer to the whole set of questions
./target/release/simple_a2a_client --port 9080
