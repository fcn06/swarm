Agent response:
  Rust is a modern programming language offering a compelling combination of performance, reliability, and productivity. Its key benefits include memory safety (preventing common bugs like dangling pointers and data races), zero-cost abstractions (high-level code without sacrificing performance), a powerful tooling ecosystem (Cargo, Rustfmt, Clippy), excellent interoperability (FFI and WebAssembly), and compile-time guarantees that reduce runtime errors. While it has a steeper learning curve, Rust is well-suited for systems programming, web development, game development, and more.
