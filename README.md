# üöÄ Swarm: Build, Connect, and Orchestrate Intelligent Agents in Rust ü¶Ä

## **Why Swarm?**

Tired of siloed AI agents? Swarm empowers you to build, connect, and orchestrate intelligent agents in Rust, allowing them to communicate, collaborate, and tackle complex tasks together. We combine two powerful communication protocols (MCP and A2A) and an orchestration capability to create a control center for your digital assistants.

Whether you're a Rust enthusiast, an AI developer, or just curious about multi-agent systems, Swarm provides a flexible and powerful framework for your agentic applications!

## **üöÄ Getting Started & Prerequisites**

Ready to dive in? Here's how to get your first Swarm.rs components up and running.

**1. Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

**2. Obtain LLM API Keys:** To enable your agents to think and communicate, you'll need access to an OpenAI-compatible chat completion API. We recommend:

*   **Groq:** For speed and efficiency (we've had great success with the `qwen/qwen3-32b` model). [https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions](https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions)
*   **Gemini:** Also tested and supported. [https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions](https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions)

**3. Build Swarm:** Compile the workspace to ensure all dependencies are in sync:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## **üí° Core Components of Swarm**

Swarm is built around three key intelligent agent components:

*   **A2A Agent (Agent-to-Agent Protocol):** üó£Ô∏è A simple, autonomous agent capable of direct communication with other A2A agents. It can also integrate an MCP Runtime for external interactions.
*   **MCP Runtime (Model Context Protocol):** üõ†Ô∏è A powerful runtime that enables agents to interact with external services and data sources. Imagine your agents querying a weather API or accessing a database!
*   **Full Agent:** üß† An advanced A2A agent that acts as an orchestrator. It connects to various other A2A agents and an MCP server, understands their available skills and tools, creates a plan based on a user request, and executes it. This enables complex agentic network designs.

## **üåê How It Works: A Glimpse into the Architecture**

The diagram below illustrates how our agents, powered by MCP and A2A, interact under the guidance of the Full Agent. This architecture allows agents to communicate with each other to achieve sub-goals, connect to the outside world, and execute complex plans.

</p>

*   **MCP RunTime:** Connects agents to external tools and services (e.g., fetching real-time data, interacting with APIs).
*   **A2A Agents:** Specialized agents handling specific tasks, capable of embedding an MCP runtime.
*   **Full Agent:** The "brain" of the operation. It understands the overall goal, breaks it down, accesses skills from other A2A agents and tools from the MCP middleware, and directs the execution of the plan.

*(Note: An optional MCP Server is provided in the `examples` section for testing purposes.)*

## **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details**

The `configuration` directory is your go-to for customizing agent behavior. Here's a quick overview:

| File Name                | Purpose                                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_a2a_config.toml`  | Configures A2A server agents, including optional embedded MCP agents.                    |
| `agent_mcp_config.toml`  | Configures the MCP runtime settings.                                                     |
| `agent_full_config.toml` | Configures the orchestrating Full Agent.                                                 |

**LLM Models:** We've found `qwen/qwen3-32b` to be highly effective, especially for MCP interactions. Each agent can connect to its own LLM. URLs are parameterized in the config files, while API keys need to be injected at runtime as environment variables.

*(To enable MCP features, an MCP server must be running. You can find one in the `examples` for testing.)*

## **üöÄ Launching Your Agents**

Let's fire up some agents! Remember to set the required API key environment variables (e.g., `LLM_A2A_API_KEY`, `LLM_FULL_API_KEY`, `LLM_MCP_API_KEY`) before running the commands.

*   **Simple Standalone A2A Agent Server:** Your individual intelligent assistant. You can run multiple A2A agents, each with its own configuration. (The example A2A agent embeds an MCP agent.)

    ```bash
    # Run compiled binary.
    # LLM_A2A_API_KEY: API Key for the A2A agent's LLM.
    # LLM_MCP_API_KEY: Optional API Key for the embedded MCP Runtime's LLM (can be the same as A2A).
    # Both API keys must be compatible with llm_url defined in the config file.
    # You can define log level (default is "warn").
    ./target/release/simple_agent_server --config-file "configuration/agent_a2a_config.toml" --log-level "warn"
    ```

*   **Full Agent Server (Orchestrator):** Ask the Full Agent to achieve a goal by providing a user query. This agent can connect to other A2A agents and MCP tools.

    ```bash
    # Run compiled binary.
    # LLM_FULL_API_KEY: API Key for the Full Agent's LLM.
    # LLM_MCP_API_KEY: Optional API Key for the embedded MCP Runtime's LLM (can be the same as Full Agent).
    # Both API keys must be compatible with llm_url defined in the config file.
    # You can define log level (default is "warn").
    ./target/release/full_agent_server
    ```

## **üî¨ Under the Hood: Swarm.rs Crate Breakdown**

The Swarm project is composed of several specialized sub-crates, each serving a distinct purpose:

*   `a2a_agent_backbone`: Provides the foundational code for a simple A2A agent. It can incorporate an MCP runtime for external interactions and connect to its own LLM.
*   `a2a_full_backbone`: The core of the orchestrating Full Agent. It connects to declared A2A agents and an MCP server, understands their skills and tools, creates, and executes plans to achieve your goals. It also connects to its own LLM.
*   `configuration`: Manages all Swarm.rs configuration files, making it easy to customize agent behavior.
*   `llm_api`: Offers a convenient interface for interacting with various Large Language Models via an OpenAI-compatible API.
*   `mcp_agent_backbone`: A runtime designed to be integrated into an A2A agent, granting it the capability to connect to an external set of tools via an MCP server. It can be connected to its own LLM.
*   `agent_discovery_service`: An optional HTTP service where agents can register themselves. It exposes an endpoint to list all available agents, facilitating dynamic discovery.
*   `examples`: Contains multiple illustrative examples to help you interact with Swarm:
    *   `mcp_agent_endpoint`: A testing utility for an MCP runtime to receive and process requests through an MCP server.
    *   `a2a_agent_endpoint`: A testing utility to interact directly with an A2A agent via a REST API. Also includes a simple UI for testing your configuration.
    *   `mcp_server`: A basic MCP server exposing three tools, primarily for testing purposes.

## **üó∫Ô∏è Road Ahead & How You Can Contribute**

Swarm.rs is a project born out of discovery and exploration! While not production-ready, it's a fantastic playground for understanding how these protocols can be combined to build powerful agentic systems.

We're continuously working on improvements, including:

*   **UI Implementation:** Developing a simple UI for interacting with A2A agents (both `simple_agent_server` and `full_agent_server`).
*   **Code Refactoring:** Continuously improving code clarity and maintainability (e.g., refactoring of `simple_a2a_agent` is the next task).
*   **Unit Tests:** Enhancing robustness and reliability across the codebase.

We're eager for your comments, suggestions, and contributions! Whether it's a bug report, a feature idea, or a pull request, your input helps shape the future of Swarm.rs. Join our community and help us build the next generation of intelligent agent orchestration!
