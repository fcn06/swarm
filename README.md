# **Swarm: Orchestrating Intelligent Agents in Rust ðŸ¦€**

## **Welcome to Swarm\!**

Swarm.rs is a Rust project that empowers you to build and orchestrate intelligent agents. Think of it as a control center for your digital assistants, allowing them to communicate, collaborate, and tackle complex tasks together.

We combine two powerful communication protocols, and an orchestration capability:

* MCP (Microservice Communication Protocol): For agents to interact with external services and data sources. Imagine your agents querying a weather API or accessing a database\!  

* A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol): For agents to implement MCP runtime and soon to talk directly to each other, sharing information and coordinating efforts.

* An orchestration layer is implemented with our Planner. It's the brain of the operation, observing your agents, understanding their capabilities, and orchestrating them to achieve ambitious goals.

Whether you're a Rust enthusiast, an AI developer, or just curious about multi-agent systems, we invite you to explore Swarm\!

## **Why Swarm?**

* Rust-powered performance and safety: Build robust and efficient agent systems.  
* Flexible architecture: Easily integrate with external services and create collaborative agent networks.  
* Intuitive orchestration: The Planner simplifies complex multi-agent workflows.  
* Open for collaboration: We're actively developing and welcome your ideas and contributions\!

## **How It Works: A Glimpse into the Architecture**

The diagram below illustrates how our agents, powered by MCP and A2A, interact under the guidance of the Planner.

* MCP RunTime: Enable  agents to connect to the outside world (e.g., fetching real-time data, interacting with APIs).  
* A2A Agents: Agents that specialize in specific tasks, an can embed an MCP runtime. 
* Planner: The orchestrator that understands the overall goal, breaks it down, and directs the A2A agents to execute the plan.Through planner, agents can communicate with each other to achieve sub-goals.  
* When Planner is used as an A2A Planner Server, it can also enables recursivity, as well as more complex pattern.

## **Getting Started: Join the Swarm\!**

Ready to dive in? Here's how to get your first Swarm.rs components up and running.

### **Prerequisites**

To enable your agents to think and communicate, you'll need access to an OpenAI-compatible chat completion API.

* Our recommendation for speed: [Groq](https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions) (we've had great success with the qwen/qwen3-32b model).  
* Also tested with: [Gemini](https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/chat/completions).

You'll also benefit from having an mcp\_server running. 

Here is a separate complementary project may be used to start your testing :

* Test MCP Server : [https://github.com/fcn06/mcp_server](https://github.com/fcn06/mcp_server) 


### **Building swarm**

First, compile the workspace to ensure all dependencies are in sync:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### **Configuration Details**

The configuration directory is your go-to for customizing agent behavior:

*   `agent_a2a_config.toml`: Configuration for A2A server agents. ( They can embed mcp agents)
*   `agent_mcp_config.toml`: Configuration for MCP runtime.
*   `agent_planner_config.toml`: Configuration for the planner stand alone agent, or planner a2a server agent.

LLM Models:  We've found `qwen/qwen3-32b` to be highly effective, especially for MCP interactions.  

Each model can access to its own LLM. The urls are parametrized in config files while API KEY needs to be injected at runtime.

## **KickStart**

We created a launcher project , so that you can experiment easily launching Swarm Agents

* Swarm Launcher : [https://github.com/fcn06/swarm_launcher](https://github.com/fcn06/swarm_launcher) 

You will be able to launch an a2a agent ( with or without MCP capability), a simple planner, and a planner agent ( to enable recursivity)


## **Manual Launching of Agents**

Now, let's fire up some agents\!

* A2A Agent Server (your individual intelligent assistants):  
  You can run multiple A2A agents, each with its own configuration.  ( In the example, the a2a agent embeds a MCP agent )

```bash
  # Run compiled binary.
  # LLM_A2A_API_KEY (for normal agent) and LLM_MCP_API_KEY (for mcp embedded if any) needs to be defined upfront
  # They need to be compatible with llm_url defined in config file for a2a agents and mcp runtime(Gemini, Groq or whatever else that you use) 
  # You can define log level as well. Default Level is warn
  ./target/release/simple_agent_server --config-file "configuration/agent_a2a_config.toml" --log-level "warn"
```

* Planner (the orchestrator):  
  Ask the Planner to achieve a goal by providing a user query.  

```bash
  # Run compiled binary.
  # LLM_PLANNER_API_KEY needs to be defined upfront.
  # It needs to be compatible with llm url defined in config file for planner agent (Gemini, Groq or whatever else that you use) 
  # You can define log level as well. Default is warn
  ./target/release/planner_agent --user-query "What is the weather in Boston?" --log-level "info"
```
  *Remember to replace "What is the weather in Boston?" with your own query\!*


## **Under the Hood: Swarm.rs Crate Breakdown**

The swarm project is composed of several specialized sub-crates:

* `a2a_agent_backbone`: The core of the framework. Implement an A2A agent server that can if needed incorporate MCP runtime for external interactions. It can be connected to its own LLM 
* `a2a_planner_backbone`: The brain for the A2A Planner. It connects to declared A2A agents, understands their skills, creates a plan, and executes it to achieve your goals. Available as a standalone agent, as well as an A2A agent server. It can be connected to its own LLM 
* `configuration`: Manages all your Swarm.rs configuration files.  
* `llm_api`: Provides a convenient interface for interacting with various Large Language Models via an OpenAI-compatible API.  
* `mcp_agent_backbone`: A runtime to interact with MCP server. Designed to be integrated into an A2A agent, granting him capability to connect to external set of tools. The MCP runtime can be connected to its own LLM. Note: An external mcp\_server (like the illustrative project or Apify) is needed for these agents to function.  
* `examples`: Contain mulitple illustrative examples to interact with swarm
    * `mcp_agent_endpoint`: A testing utility for MCP runtime to receive and process requests through a MCP server. 

## **Road Ahead & How You Can Contribute**

Swarm.rs is a project born out of discovery and exploration\! While not production-ready, it's a fantastic playground for understanding how these protocols can be combined to build powerful agentic systems.

We're continuously working on improvements, including:

* Implementation of .a discovery agent, that would hold the various agents available and their skills
* Implementation of a Bi-Directional agent, that will be more flexible than Planner
* Refactoring: Continuously improving code clarity and maintainability.  
* Unit Tests: Enhancing robustness and reliability.

We're eager for your comments, suggestions, and contributions\! Whether it's a bug report, a feature idea, or a pull request, your input helps shape the future of Swarm.rs.
